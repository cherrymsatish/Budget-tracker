# Budget Tracker

This is a simple console-based budget tracker written in Python. It allows you to keep track of your income and expenses and provides basic financial analysis features.

## Features

1. **Add Income**: You can add your income to the budget tracker, specifying the amount.

2. **Add Expense**: You can add expenses, including a category and the amount. The expenses are categorized for analysis.

3. **Calculate Budget**: The system can calculate your remaining budget by deducting expenses from your income.

4. **Expense Analysis**: You can see an analysis of your expenses by category, which helps you identify where your money is going.

5. **Clear All Data and Start Fresh**: If you want to start over with a clean slate, you can clear all your past data.

## Usage

1. Run the script in your Python environment.

2. The program will present a menu with the following options:

   - **Add Income**: Add your income.
   
   - **Add Expense**: Add an expense with a category and amount.
   
   - **Calculate Budget**: See your remaining budget after expenses.
   
   - **Expense Analysis**: View an analysis of your expenses by category.
   
   - **Clear All Data and Start Fresh**: Clear all past data to start over.
   
   - **Exit**: Exit the program.

3. Follow the prompts and choose the appropriate option by entering the corresponding number.

## Data Persistence

Your income, expenses, and expense categories are stored in a JSON file called `budget_data.json`. This file is created in the same directory as the script. Your data is loaded when you run the script and saved when you choose to exit or clear all data.

## Dependencies

The script relies on Python's built-in `json` module for data storage and retrieval.
